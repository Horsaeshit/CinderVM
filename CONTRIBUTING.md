# Contributing to CinderVM

Thanks for considering a contribution. This document describes the toolchain,
the conventions, and the review bar. Read it before opening a PR; the corpus
and the ISA tables have rules that CI will not remind you about.

## Prerequisites

- Rust >= 1.78. The pinned toolchain lives in `rust-toolchain.toml`; `rustup`
  picks it up automatically on `cd` into the repo.
- Go >= 1.22, only if you touch `cmd/cinderd` or `internal/`.

There is no C toolchain, no build script, and no system library dependency.

## Development setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ashish/cindervm
cd cindervm
make            # debug build of both halves
make test       # unit + corpus conformance + Go tests + cross-language e2e
make verify     # clippy -D warnings, rustfmt, go vet, staticcheck, isa drift
```

`make verify` is the gate: a green local `make verify && make test` is what CI
runs, so a green CI is a formality. Individual cargo commands:

```sh
cargo build --workspace
cargo test  --all-features
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all --check
```

Fuzzing and benchmarks:

```sh
make fuzz T=60   # 60s of bytecode fuzzing against the verifier/interpreter pair
make bench       # criterion, baseline-compared
make miri        # nightly Miri over heap:: and cont:: only
```

## Making changes

The crate is deliberately flat and the boundaries follow the machine's
structure. If you are unsure where a change belongs, ask in the issue before
writing code. `src/isa.rs` is the single definition of the instruction set —
the opcode table, operand shapes, stack effects, and type rules live in one
`const` array, and the assembler, disassembler, verifier, and `docs/isa.md`
are all derived from it.

### Branch naming

Branch off `main`. Never commit to `main` directly.

| Prefix | Use |
|---|---|
| `feat/` | new opcodes, instructions, or CLI surface |
| `fix/` | bug fixes, including fuzzer findings |
| `perf/` | performance work with a benchmark to prove it |
| `refactor/` | no behavior change, structure only |
| `test/` | corpus, integration, or property tests |
| `docs/` | documentation only |
| `ci/` | workflows, tooling, dependency bumps |

### Commit messages

Conventional Commits, lowercase imperative subject, optional scope, with a
body when the why is not obvious:

```
feat(verifier): report both predecessor blocks on E_DEPTH_MERGE

The diagnostic named only the first predecessor, which made merges
reachable from three or more blocks confusing to debug. Collect all
predecessors during the fixpoint and list them in order of visit.

Closes #214
```

- Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `ci`.
