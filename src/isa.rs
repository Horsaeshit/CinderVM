//! The `cdx/4` instruction set: encoding, operand shapes, stack effects, and
//! type rules.
//!
//! This module is the single definition of the ISA. The assembler's mnemonic
//! table, the disassembler, the verifier's transfer functions, and
//! `docs/isa.md` are all derived from [`TABLE`] rather than restating it, so
//! adding an instruction is a one-line change plus a semantics arm in
//! `interp.rs` — and `isa::table_is_dense` fails the build if the two drift.
//!
//! # Encoding
//!
//! Fixed four bytes, little-endian:
//!
//! ```text
//!  byte 0     byte 1     bytes 2..4
//! ┌─────────┬──────────┬────────────────┐
//! │ opcode  │ operand  │ operand b      │
//! │   u8    │   a: u8  │      u16       │
//! └─────────┴──────────┴────────────────┘
//! ```
//!
//! Opcode `0xFF` is the wide prefix: it is followed by a full instruction whose
//! `b` field is extended by the prefix's own `a`/`b` operands to 32 bits. This
//! keeps the common case at four bytes while allowing constant pools larger
//! than 65 536 entries, which real prompt-heavy images hit.
