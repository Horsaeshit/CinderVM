//! Per-function control-flow graph: basic blocks over instruction *indices*,
//! reverse postorder, Cooper-Harvey-Kennedy dominators, and dominator-based
//! back edges.
//!
//! # What this module guarantees
//!
//! A successfully built [`Cfg`] proves, for one function:
//!
//! - the code range decodes cleanly and lands exactly on the function's end
//!   boundary (otherwise `E_MISALIGNED` / `E_BAD_OPCODE`);
//! - every control-flow edge — branch target, `switch` arm, and implicit
//!   fallthrough alike — names an instruction inside the function (otherwise
//!   `E_BAD_TARGET`);
//! - the block partition covers `0..insn_count` exactly once, so
//!   [`Cfg::block_of`] is total over that range;
//! - [`Cfg::rpo`] lists exactly the blocks reachable from block 0, and
//!   [`Cfg::idom`] is defined for every one of them except the entry.
//!
//! # What it assumes the caller proved
//!
//! Nothing. `Cfg::build` is the *first* pass over a function's bytecode:
//! `verify.rs` builds one before it does anything else, so the CFG cannot
//! assume any verifier fact. It does assume `f.code_off`/`f.code_len` describe
//! a range the container's section layout already bounds-checked, and reports
//! `E_TRUNCATED` if not.
//!
//! # Indices, not byte offsets
//!
//! Everything public counts instructions, function-locally: index 0 is the
//! function's first instruction. Because [`Decoded::len`] is 4 or 8 — the wide
//! prefix doubles it — index↔offset is *not* a multiply, so `build` caches the
//! decoded stream and a parallel index→offset table once instead of rescanning
//! from the function start on every query. That makes [`Cfg::insn_at`] and
//! [`Cfg::byte_offset`] O(1) and, more importantly, keeps every consumer
//! (verifier, disassembler) from reimplementing the walk and disagreeing about
//! where instruction *n* begins.
