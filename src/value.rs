//! The VM's value representation and heap handles.
//!
//! # Why 16 bytes and `Copy`
//!
//! Every operand in the machine is a [`Value`]: a one-byte tag, seven bytes of
//! padding, and eight bytes of payload. It is `Copy`, contains no host pointer,
//! and has no `Drop`. That is what makes `cont::snapshot` a memcpy of the
//! operand array instead of a graph traversal — see the module docs in
//! `cont.rs` for the full argument.
//!
//! The cost is that anything larger than eight bytes lives in the arena and is
//! referenced by a [`Handle`], an arena-relative offset. Handles are *not*
//! pointers: relocating an arena is arithmetic on the base, so a restored
//! snapshot needs no pointer patching.
