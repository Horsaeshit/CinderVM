//! Diagnostics: source spans, stable error codes, and rendering.
//!
//! Every failure in this crate is a [`Diag`] carrying a machine-readable
//! [`Code`] and, where a source is available, a span into it. The codes are
//! part of the public contract — `corpus/MANIFEST.tsv` names the exact code
//! each rejected image must produce, so renaming one breaks the conformance
//! suite on purpose.

use core::fmt;

/// Byte range into a source file, plus a precomputed line/column for rendering.
///
/// Spans survive assembly: `asm` attaches one to every emitted instruction and
/// `image` stores them in an optional debug section, which is what lets a
/// *verifier* failure point at `.cdx` source even though the verifier only ever
/// sees bytecode.
