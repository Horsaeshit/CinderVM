//! # cindervm
//!
//! A deterministic bytecode virtual machine for agent execution.
//!
//! Agent runs are long-lived, effectful, and resumable. This crate models one as
//! bytecode on a machine built for it, rather than as a host-language coroutine
//! whose suspended state has no serializable form. The payoff is that a run can
//! be snapshotted mid-flight, moved to another host, and replayed exactly from
//! its journal.
//!
//! ## The three invariants
//!
//! Most of this codebase's shape follows from three rules. They are stated here
//! because every module depends on the others honouring them.
//!
//! ### 1. The interpreter performs no I/O
//!
//! [`interp::Vm::step`] is a pure function of `(image, state, answer)`. When it
//! needs an effect it returns a [`trap::Trap`] describing what it wants and
//! stops. The host performs the effect and hands back an [`trap::Answer`].
//!
//! This is what makes replay exact rather than approximate: `replay::Host`
//! serves answers from a journal instead of from the network, and the
//! interpreter cannot tell the difference because there was never a code path
//! that touched the network to begin with.
//!
//! ### 2. Every value is `Copy`, tagged, and pointer-free
//!
//! [`value::Value`] is 16 bytes with an explicit tag byte and no `Drop`. Larger
//! payloads live in the arena behind a [`value::Handle`], which is an
//! arena-relative offset rather than a pointer.
//!
//! Consequently [`cont::snapshot`] is two memcpys and a hash, and
//! [`cont::restore`] relocates by arithmetic. No graph walk, no identity map, no
//! cycle detection.
//!
//! ### 3. Verification is a precondition, not a mode
//!
//! An [`image::Image`] cannot be constructed except through [`verify::admit`].
//! By the time the interpreter sees one, the following have been *proved*, not
//! assumed:
//!
//! - the operand stack depth at every instruction is single-valued and within
//!   the function's declared `maxstack`;
//! - every operand has a type the instruction accepts;
//! - no [`value::Tag::Pending`] is live at a return or snapshot boundary;
//! - every branch target is a real instruction in the same function;
//! - every cycle in the control-flow graph contains a metering instruction;
//! - `fork`/`commit`/`abort` nesting agrees on all paths.
//!
//! So [`interp`] contains no stack-depth checks, no `pc` bounds checks, and no
//! operand-count checks. Those are not omissions — re-checking a verified
//! property in the dispatch loop would cost throughput and hide verifier bugs by
//! turning them into runtime errors.
//!
//! ## Layout
//!
//! | Module | Role |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`isa`] | Opcode table, encoding, stack effects, type rules. Everything else derives from it. |
//! | [`value`] | Tagged operands and arena handles. |
//! | [`diag`] | Spans, stable error codes, rendered diagnostics. |
//! | [`lex`], [`asm`] | `.cdx` front end. |
//! | [`image`] | `.cdxb` container: sections, sealing, tables. |
//! | [`cfg`], [`verify`] | Basic blocks, dominators, the abstract interpreter. |
//! | [`frame`], [`heap`], [`ctx`], [`budget`] | Machine state. |
//! | [`interp`], [`trap`] | Dispatch loop and the host boundary. |
//! | [`cont`], [`journal`], [`replay`] | Durability and time travel. |
//! | [`disas`], [`wire`] | Disassembly and the supervisor protocol. |
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use cindervm::{asm, verify, interp, trap};
